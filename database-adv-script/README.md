# ğŸ“Š Advanced SQL Scripts for Airbnb Clone

This folder contains advanced SQL practice tasks completed as part of the ALX Airbnb Backend Project. The focus was on mastering complex SQL concepts, optimizing database performance, and applying real-world techniques for scalable systems.

### âœ… Covered Topics

- **SQL Joins**: Used INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER JOINs to combine user, property, booking, and review data.
- **Subqueries**: Wrote both non-correlated and correlated subqueries for ratings and user activity.
- **Aggregations & Window Functions**: Used COUNT, GROUP BY, and window functions like `ROW_NUMBER` and `RANK` to analyze booking data.
- **Indexing for Optimization**: Identified high-usage columns and created appropriate indexes to improve query performance.
- **Query Performance Tuning**: Used `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` to identify bottlenecks and refactor complex joins.
- **Table Partitioning**: Partitioned the large `bookings` table by `start_date` to improve query efficiency.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitored key queries and adjusted schema/indexes for faster data access.
